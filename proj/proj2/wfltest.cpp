/*
 * Interactive tester for WordFreqLinkedList class
 *
 * Makes a single instance of a WordFreqLinkedList and then runs a
 * command loop that allows one to call each of the functions in the
 * interface.  
 *
 * Mark A. Sheldon, Tufts University, Spring 2021
 *
 *
 *
 * TODO:  Students should fill in appropriate test code in the command
 *        loop (see TODO items below).
 *        You may define helper functions to call.  If you do, you
 *        must pass the list by reference using a pointer --- you
 *        cannot pass it by value.
 *        Do keep functions under 30 lines long!
