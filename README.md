# Comp11 Coursework

This contains all my work for the Spring 2021 Comp11 course at Tufts University. This repository is updated as a backup copy of my work and proof that everything was done in time. Please do not _copy_ this word for word or I will be forced to make this private.

Many labs are incomplete since I was not required to complete them, but all homeworks and projects are complete to the best of my ability.

Many of these files are based on provided starter code written for the purposes of the class, but all other code is created solely by me.
